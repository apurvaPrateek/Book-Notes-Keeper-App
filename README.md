This is my first majore project.
It is BOOK NOTES KEEPER APP, where I can store the book and its reviews that I have read.
It uses Node js, express js, ejs templating, public api, PostgreSql database.

In order to run this in your computer, first set up database in postgres,
then run command:
npm i
node index.js


It uses functionalitites like all CRUD operations for adding, updating, deleting, reading the files using various SQL commands.
ISBN number is used to fetch book covers from a public API.
